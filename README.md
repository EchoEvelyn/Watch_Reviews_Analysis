# Watch Reviews Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer reviews of watches using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to extract insights that can help with product improvement, problem identification, and targeted marketing strategies. The analysis covers tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization, K-means clustering, and topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
